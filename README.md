# Maze Generator and Solver

This project is a C program that generates a random maze and provides different algorithms to solve it, including **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and **A* Search**. The program features a graphical user interface (GUI) using **GTK** for interactive maze generation and solving.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generates a random maze with walls and paths.
- **Multiple Solving Algorithms**:
  - **BFS**: Solves the maze by exploring the nearest unvisited neighbor first.
  - **DFS**: Solves the maze by exploring one path as far as possible before backtracking.
  - **Dijkstra**: Solves the maze by finding the shortest path based on the minimum distance.
  - **A***: Solves the maze using the A* algorithm, which uses heuristics for more efficient pathfinding.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a simple and interactive interface for generating the maze and running the solving algorithms.
  
## Prerequisites
